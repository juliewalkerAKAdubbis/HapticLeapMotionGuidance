# HapticLeapMotionGuidance
This integrates the leap motion tracker to track the thumb and index finger with a custom skin-stretch haptic device that receives commands through the serial port and arduino.
The master branch is the basic working version that just displays the tracked hands and allows the user to apply haptic cues from the keyboard.
